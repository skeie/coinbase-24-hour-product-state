# 24 hours state for Coinbase's products

This repo was done as part of a code challenge. For testing, `react-native-testing-library` is used, and for fetching data, `react-fetching-library` is used. Other than that, it's typed with `Typescript`

## Run

- `yarn`
- Run `react-native run-ios` - It's optimized for ios.

## Tests

- yarn test

## Disclaimer

- Design-wise, it does the job, but it does not look nice.
- Commits, I only have two commits, I should have split it up in chunck-commits as things where finished. But but :)
